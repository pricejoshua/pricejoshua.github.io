title: 'Agenda Buddy'
---

Agenda Buddy was an app created in my sophmore level software development class. The idea for the app was to create an agenda app for Wheaton College. This included community events, personal events, and weather information. The app was created using Java and Android Studio. The app was created in a group of 4, and I was responsible for the backend of the app, as well as some of the app. I used PHP and MySQL to create a REST API that the app could use to store and retrieve data.
