title: 'Marching to Zion'
---
This was an app created for the #HACK2022 hackathon. The idea for the app was to create a way for people to find other Christians in their area to fellowship with. The main way this was done is through devotional content, where one can chat and engage with other users using Pusher. The app was created using React Native and a Laravel backend. I was responsible for the frontend of the app, and was responsible for part of the backend as well. The app was created in 48 hours.
