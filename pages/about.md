# Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Joshua Price. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Wheaton College. I have experience in web development, mobile development, and backend development. I am currently looking for a full time position in software development. I have had lots of cross-cultural experience, which has given me a unique perspective on life and work. I am passionate about using technology to help people and make the world a better place. I also want to continue to explore the intersection of faith and technology, and would love to think and talk more about that with you.
